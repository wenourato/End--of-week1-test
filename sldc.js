// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

console.log("2. Analysis of Requirements")
console.log("3. Design")
console.log("4. Implementaition")
console.log("5. Testing & Integration")
console.log("6. Maintain")

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
*/
var Planning = "The client defines a problem that needs to be solved, which further forms the basis for finalizing the requirements. All the information from the client and users (if required) is gathered to create requirements documents so that the development team understands what they are building."

var Analysis = "Detailed analysis of the software is performed  to identify overall requirements of client.  This step is nescessary to make adjjustments and to ensure that software functions properly at the end"

var Design = "This phase of the software development life cycle focuses on creating software architecture, prototype, and user experience design"

var Implementation = "This phase is executed by the coders who work on bringing the concept into reality. The developers create KLOCs (thousands of lines of code) using programming languages they feel comfortable with."

var Testing = "This phase of the application development life cycle focuses on testing the written code for bugs and other inconsistencies. Here, the testing and quality assurance team works together to test and report the bugs to the development team."

var Maintain = "New requirements are likely to drop in with the introduction of new technologies and changing user requirements. To accommodate these requirements, the software development team needs to iterate through the entire software development life cycle to work on the new change."
