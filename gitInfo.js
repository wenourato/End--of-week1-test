/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE
var gitDefinition = ("Git is a program used to create and edit files, and navigate through your computer instead of using the GUI, for a non-linear workflow")
//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
var gitHubDefinition = ("GitHub is  a website, unlike Git. It is essentially a host for software development, where users can upload and share .js files ")
//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 8////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.
*/

//CODE HERE
var init = ("'git init' creats a new repository.  You can use this command to convert an exsisting project, or create a new one.");
//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'clone' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the clone command.
*/

//CODE HERE
var clone = ("Clone, is what it sounds like.  It is used to cope, or 'clone' a repository into a new locol directory.")
//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'status' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the status command.
*/

//CODE HERE
var status = ('git status will show you the state of the working directory and the staging area.  It also lets you see what changes you have made.')
//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'add' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the add command.
*/

//CODE HERE
var add = ('git add will add all modified and new files in the current directory, and all subdirectories to the staging are (index)')
//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'commit' with 'description' and 'code' properties
    following the guidelines above to describe the commit command.
*/

//CODE HERE
var commit = ('Commit will capture a snapshot of the projects (.js) currently staged changes ')

//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'push' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the push command.
*/

//CODE HERE
var push = ("git push is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.  Like transfering from your PC to github!")
